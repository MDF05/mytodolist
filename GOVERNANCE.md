# Governance Model

## Overview
**MDF Note** is an open-source project maintained by the community. This document outlines how decisions are made and how the project is managed.

## Roles

### Maintainers
Maintainers have write access to the repository. They are responsible for:
-   Reviewing and merging Pull Requests.
-   Triaging Issues.
-   Steering the project roadmap.
-   Enforcing the Code of Conduct.

### Contributors
Anyone who submits code, documentation, or issue reports. Contributors can become maintainers through sustained high-quality contributions.

## Decision Making Process

1.  **Proposals:** Major changes must be proposed via an Issue or Discussion.
2.  **Consensus:** Maintainers aim for consensus. If consensus cannot be reached, the Project Lead (if appointed) has the deciding vote.
3.  **Transparency:** All decisions happen publicly on GitHub.

## Project Ownership

This project is currently maintained by the **MDF Note Team**. We welcome new maintainers who share our vision for a fast, local-first note-taking experience.
